## Some Infos About Me  
My name is Oliver, I am working as a civil engineer in inspecting structural analysis, located in the southern of bavaria.
In the years from 2000 to 2013 I was working as a full-time software-developer on geotechnical software for civil engineers. 
I am still a passionate software-developer and in my spare time I am working on job-related tools mostly with VBC/VBA and Excel.
Every software-developer always benefits from open-source and from people who share their knowledge. 
So do I, and with my GitHub-repos I try to give something back to the community, hoping to be helpful.
Software is not only a tool but also knowledge, if you are able to read it.
  
## Some Infos About Programming Skills  
I started learning programming in university in 1993 on a comtech AMD 386-DX-40 with Windows 3.1 and Fortran 77. 
In 1995 I switched to Borland Delphi (=Object Pascal) 3 then 5 later 7 and also Freepascal with Lazarus.
At the same time I started programming my graphical calculator HP48G in Reverse Polish Lisp (UPN).
From the year 2000 on, as already mentioned, I got a job as a professional software developer in Visual Basic 6.
I am constantly looking over the fences (beyond my own nose 8-), and so I learned C, C++, C# and VB.NET In my spare time.
In 2006 I started sharing my knowledge and to benefit from others in forums about programming, mainly at ActiveVB.de.
In 2009 I found Jabaco a Basic to Java compiler, it was very useful to become acquaintanted with the Java framework.
  
## Some Thoughts About Programming  
Let me tell you one word, every engineering-company should have, and needs at least one software developer. 
Time is money and in the last years I stuck with Visual Basic VBA and Excel, as it is truly a Rapid Application Development Tool 
(RAD) you just have to know how to use it. Remember Frank Sinatra: "If you can make it there you can make it anywhere, it's up to you ..."  
Use and reuse your own code over and over again as much as you can. It helps constantly testing and improving your own code-basis.
  
## Some Infos About Sourcecode-Structure  
Some of my repos are standalone but most of the repos heavily rely on other repos. 
If you try to compile my software just download the repo you like, maybe there are some classes in other repos. 
Don't hesitate, everything is there, just have a look into the VB-project-file and download the missing repos side by side. 
If you have any questions concerning my codes, feel free to open an issue, I understand "issues" also as a kind of "communication-tool" on GitHub.
